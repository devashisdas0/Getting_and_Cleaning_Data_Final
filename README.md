# Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment

There are 3 main files for this assignment.

1. The Codebook, which gives a description of the data, and transformations made to the dataset
2. The run_analysis.R file which is a script used to change the data to a readable format
3. The result.csv file which is the final cleaned dataset
